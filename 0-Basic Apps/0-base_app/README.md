# Welcome to the Base App! :wave:

- The Base App is a fundamental Flutter application. 
- It's designed to be simple and unmodified, serving as a solid foundation for your projects. :hammer_and_wrench:


## Viewing Project Outputs :eyes:

- To see the output of any project, simply copy the entire contents of the project's `lib` folder 
- Replace the contents of the Base App's `lib` folder with it. It's that easy! :clipboard:

#### Remember, the Base App is just a starting point. It's up to you to build upon it and create something amazing! :rocket:

Happy coding! :computer:
