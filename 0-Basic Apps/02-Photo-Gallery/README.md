## Getting Started

Flutter doesn't have a built-in grid system like Bootstrap or other web frameworks. However, it provides several widgets that can be used to create a grid layout. The most commonly used widget for this purpose is `GridView`.

`GridView` is a widget in Flutter that displays its children in a scrolling grid. It takes a `GridDelegate` which determines the structure of the grid. The most common delegate is `SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount` which allows you to specify the number of columns in the grid.
